index.html-this is the html document, I created a basic title and paragraph called "March 23rd Homework!"
stylesheet.css-this is linked to the html document; I decided to color the letters blue just for fun, and to make sure it worked. 
app.jss-this javascript document is linked to the html document. 

Each of these documents are inside of a folder on my computer called PrimeAssignments.  I initialized a repo for this project I believe on my computer.
